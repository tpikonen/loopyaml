LoopYAML
========

Introduction
------------

LoopYAML is a Python module which adds the concept of looped data
arrays to the YAML_ data serialization format. Looped arrays are in
practice tabular arrays, where rows group together values of different
types found in columns. The concept was inspired by the STAR_ file
format and it's implementation in Crystallographic_Information_File_.

The implementation of this module is more than a little bit hackish,
importing the loopyaml module causes the import of the yaml module
(PyYAML_, to be exact), which is then monkey patched to serialize the
Python class LoopDict in a tabular format in the output YAML file.

The LoopDict object inherits from Dict and is serialized like YAML
map, except for the keys which are marked to belong to a loop. See
the LoopDict docstring for details.

Example usage
-------------

 >>> import loopyaml as ly
 >>> dd = { 'Date': '2011-01-01', 'I': [2.0, 2.0], 'Ierr': [3.0, 3.0], 'q': [1.0, 1.0], 'I~unit' : 'arb.', 'Ierr~unit' : 'arb.', 'q~unit' : '1/nm'}
 >>> loopd = ly.Loopdict(dd, loopvars=['q', 'I', 'Ierr'], attributes=['~unit'])
 >>> print(ly.dump(loopd))
 Date: '2011-01-01'
 =loops=:
 - $cols: [q, I, Ierr]
   +~unit: [1/nm, arb., arb.]
   ~vals: !!seq [
     1.0000000000e+00, 2.0000000000e+00, 3.0000000000e+00,
     1.0000000000e+00, 2.0000000000e+00, 3.0000000000e+00,
   ]
